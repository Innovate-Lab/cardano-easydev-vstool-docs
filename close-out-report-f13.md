## Challenge KPIs and How They Were Addressed

1.  **Enhanced Developer Adoption**

    The project developed a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that simplifies the smart contract development process through a graphical user interface (GUI). This tool lowers the entry barrier for developers new to Cardano, streamlining the development process and encouraging wider adoption.
2.  **Increased Community Engagement**

    By open-sourcing all source code under the Apache 2.0 license, the project promotes transparency and collaboration. This approach invites community contributions, fostering a vibrant and engaged developer community around the tool.
