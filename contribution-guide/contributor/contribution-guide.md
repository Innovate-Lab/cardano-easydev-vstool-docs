# Contribution Guide

## Contributing to Cardano EasyDev VS Tool

A warm welcome and sincere thanks for your interest in contributing to Cardano EasyDev VS Tool open-source project! Your involvement plays a crucial role in making this project valuable to Cardano developer community.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process for everyone. Adhering to them also shows mutual respect for the time and effort of the developers maintaining this project. In return, we are committed to reviewing your issues, evaluating changes, and assisting you in refining your pull requests.

### Getting Started

You can contribute to this repository through **Issues** and **Pull Requests (PRs)**. Here are some general guidelines to follow:

* Before opening a new issue or PR, check if a similar one already exists.
* We strive to address issues promptly, but depending on complexity and priority, it may take time to investigate. If your issue is critical, a polite reminder in the comment thread can help bring attention to it.

#### Issues

Use **Issues** to report bugs, request new features, or discuss potential changes before submitting a PR. When creating an issue, a template will guide you in providing the necessary details for our team to investigate.

If an existing issue already describes your problem, add your reproduction details there instead of opening a new one. Reacting to the issue also helps signal its impact to our maintainers.

#### Pull Requests

We welcome **Pull Requests (PRs)** to improve our project, as they provide a quick way to introduce fixes or enhancements for the next release. To ensure an efficient review process, PRs should:

* Focus on a single fix or feature, avoiding mixed changes like functionality updates and whitespace/style adjustments in the same PR.
* Include unit or integration tests for modified functionality (if a test suite exists).
* Keep changes minimal, addressing only the specific issue in as few lines as possible.
* Provide relevant documentation within the repository or on our documentation site.
* Use the automatically loaded **Pull Request template** to ensure all necessary details are included.

For significant changes, such as updates to core functionality or breaking changes (e.g., a major release), it's recommended to open an **Issue** first to discuss the proposal. While not mandatory, this can help streamline the review process.

Our contribution workflow typically follows these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the project to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** with a clear and descriptive name.
4. **Make your changes** and commit them to the branch.
5. **Follow formatting and testing guidelines** specific to this repository.
6. **Push** the changes to your fork.
7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** using the provided template to ensure a smooth review process.
